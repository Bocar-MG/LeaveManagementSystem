## Project Objectives

This backend was developed as a **test project for a leave request management system**.  
It follows software development best practices, including:

- Separation of concerns  
- Low coupling between components  
- Long-term maintainability

---

## Architecture

This project is based on **Clean Architecture**, with strict separation of responsibilities across layers.  
Reasons for choosing this architecture:

- It is the one I am most familiar with  
- It is one of the most widely used architectures in .NET application development  
- It has proven its effectiveness in many real-world projects  
- Its layered structure allows for independent work on each part of the application

---

## Features

- Clean Architecture implementation  
- RESTful API  
- Object mapping with AutoMapper  
- Global error handling via middleware  
- Decentralized configuration (each layer has its own `DependencyInjection` file)

---
